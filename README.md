# 🌊 AquaSavvy

**Where Saving Water Becomes a Fun Adventure!**

AquaSavvy transforms the serious issue of **groundwater depletion** into an exciting, interactive experience for children.  
Instead of reading boring stats, kids actively **play, learn, and practice water conservation** through engaging challenges.

Players explore three worlds — **Farm, Home, and Industry** — where they solve real-life problems like fixing leaks, setting up drip irrigation, or reusing greywater. With **coins, badges, and leaderboards**, AquaSavvy makes conservation **fun, rewarding, and impactful**.
